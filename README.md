# Basics Of Databases 

## Restaurant Management System Project

Databases store information about distinct objects, or entities, and the associations, or relationships, between these entities. A popular approach to conceptual design uses the Entity Relationship (ER) model, which helps transform the requirements into a formal description of the entities and relationships that appear in the database.

Through this project we try to establish that relationship among different entities in a resturant management system. 
After doing so we then run some queries on the model.
